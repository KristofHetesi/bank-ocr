# Bank-OCR python portfolio work
## Goal
The purpose of the project is to build a small application to interpret scanned bar accounts given as input in a certain format.
Additionally, to offer some error detection/correcting capabilities

## Project constraints
The project should be done in 2 weeks with (optimally) maximum 20 hours of work.

## Project scope
The project will be done using python with a limited number of libraries.
The main files will consist of one file for each user story as a module.
However, when a user story only adds more functionality to an existing process,
it will be contained in the same file. All the modules should be able to communicate via a caller file, but should be capable of functioning by themselves.
